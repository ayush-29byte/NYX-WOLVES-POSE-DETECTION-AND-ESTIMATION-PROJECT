# NYX-WOLVES-POSE-DETECTION-AND-ESTIMATION-PROJECT

This repository contains Python code that demonstrates how to perform pose estimation and object detection using the OpenCV library and various pre-trained models. The code showcases two different functionalities:

1. **Pose Estimation:** Detects key points of a human body's pose, such as joint positions, and visualizes them on images or videos using MediaPipe.

2. **Object Detection:** Detects objects in images or videos using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm and pre-trained weights.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- OpenCV (cv2)
- MediaPipe (mediapipe) for pose estimation
- YOLOv3 weights and configuration files for object detection

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
```

For object detection, you will need to download the YOLOv3 weights (`yolov3.weights`) and configuration files (`yolov3.cfg`) from the official YOLO website or repository.

## Pose Estimation Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pose-estimation.git
```

2. Navigate to the `pose-estimation` directory:

```bash
cd pose-estimation
```

3. Run the `pose_estimation_video.py` script to perform pose estimation on a video:

```bash
python pose_estimation_video.py
```

This script will open a video file (specified in the script) and visualize the pose keypoints on the frames.

## Object Detection Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine (if not done already):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object-detection.git
```

2. Navigate to the `object-detection` directory:

```bash
cd object-detection
```

3. Download the YOLOv3 weights (`yolov3.weights`) and configuration files (`yolov3.cfg`) and place them in the same directory.

4. Run the `object_detection_video.py` script to perform object detection on a video:

```bash
python object_detection_video.py
```

This script will open a video file (specified in the script) and display the video frames with detected objects highlighted.

## Customization

- For pose estimation, you can modify the video file path in the `pose_estimation_video.py` script to use your own video.
- For object detection, you can adjust the confidence threshold in the `object_detection_video.py` script for more accurate results.

## Credits

The code for pose estimation utilizes the MediaPipe library provided by Google. The code for object detection is based on the YOLO algorithm.
